#### One Of My Favourite Quotes

> "It might be true that there are six billion people in the world and counting. Nevertheless, what you do makes a difference. It makes a difference, first of all, in material terms. It makes a difference to other people and it sets an example."  
> ― Robert Solomon  

*Who's next?*

## Getting Organised

TLDR: Miro, GitHub, Trello, Calendar Invites (.ics), Discord, Shared Storage, e-mail.

* I do like Miro. I've not used it before, but it doesn't seem to have much of a learning curve. It does seem to have a lot of features I have not yet explored though, so I think it's worth taking some time to see what exactly it has to offer.
* As a 'tech-monkey' it's really easy for me to push stuff up to a repo. If we want to be 1337 we could use the web-of-trust model and pull from one another in a decentralised fashion. But I would simply suggest using GitHub for anything that is technical in nature.
* Trello is useful, simple as. You know who is working on what at any given time. We should probably be using Trello.
* Calendar invites are also useful for those who regularly use calendar applications (usually embedded into mail clients).
* Discord, of course.
* When it comes to educational resources (that we will discuss), the creation of content and the platform to serve it on does require disk space. It would likely be a good idea to obtain some shared disk space. We could use Google Drive, not that I am a fan of Google as a company. 
* I am happy enough to communicate via e-mail, as that is what I usually see first. But I understand that anonymity is a concern, but I am happy to deal with people either via Discord or via e-mail. If we're going to use e-mail at all, you'll probably want to ensure that you're using an encrypted mail service.

## Piloting This?

*Over to DICK__CHUCK for this one.*

*Perhaps make a case for why it is a good idea.*

*Over to Bob for that.*

*Open to discussion.*

## Bob on Academic Research & General Comments

*Over to Bob for that.*

*Open to discussion.*

## Discussion on Open Research

*Bob will likely talk about this to one degree or another.*

I would like to add that, given that I have a post-graduate diploma and the only thing I am required to do for an MSc is to write a research-based thesis. I will need to contact the University of Edinburgh, but in the UK you're typically allowed to transfer credits and resume your degree in the future. I do, however, need to verify this. Regardless, it would be nice to do some academic writing.

*Open to discussion.*

## Internal & External Resources

Right, so I do still have some more research to do. However, since I am documenting all this research, it should be fairly straightforward to refine it and create a peer-reviewed knowledge base. This would be my suggestion to feed two bison with one piece of meat.

It provides internal resources for beginners within ADAO to grasp any 'more technical' details surrounding DAOs (so long as the content has been through a peer-review process); and if they really need to, they can also begin obtaining a firm grasp of the basics.

In addition, we could open this knowledge base to the public.

Furthermore, it shouldn't be too difficult to work with marketing and produce palatable articles for the public in order to increase engagement.

It would be worth sitting down with Marketing and creating a marketing campaign.

<details>

<summary>Marketing Campaign Details</summary>

*Please bear in mind that marketing campaigns are built to appeal to the public, the masses. Thus, we may consider using platforms that we normally otherwise would not use.*

Pre-requisite information, decisions that need to be made.

* Are we happy to use all forms of social media?
* Question: should a DAO have a LinkedIn?
* Primary Social Media (based on our audience): Facebook, YouTube, Telegram, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn.
* Creating a Mail list (Personally, I would use Mailchimp for this).
* I don't imagine too many... Gen-Z? People (who use TikTok & the works) would be interested in on-chain governance and DAOs. But, I hear that those platforms do have a lot of potential in terms of growing a brand, although I am unfamiliar with them.
* We should be distributing blog posts and articles.
* We should probably have an RSS feed.
* It would be great to be able to distribute media such as the video that Bob created, commenting on the paper from IOHK.

I would propose (EDIT: on second thoughts, maybe not, perhaps social consensus initially would be better, see<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>) we take a vote on:

* Which social media platforms we should use.
* Whether or not a mail list is important and should be implemented & by what means (consider GDPR, legal issues, most of which are handled by Mailchimp).
* Should we use newer social media platforms?
* Should we be distributing blog posts and articles?
* If so, who is fit to write them? IMO they should be written by anyone within the DAO, then peer-reviewed, finalised and voted on as to whether they're pushed out or not (however, this does create a problem<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.
* Should we set up an RSS feed?
* Simply vote on outgoing content.

*Note: during the early stages of a DAO, it may be acceptable to allow members to delegate their 'virtual' (since they don't actually have any yet) voting power to working group leads. This would circumvent the problem presented by<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.*

How I have been trained to run a marketing campaign:

*This literally is a full-time job BTW. Threw this together quickly, so it's probably missing quite a few things.*

**First thing is first:**

* Ensure you have a vision set that people can buy into. Whether it is a product, a service, whatever. You need to convince yourself you believe in it enough to market it. Thankfully we're all here because we do believe in these technologies and organisational structures. Vision setting IS IMPORTANT.

**Setting up:**

* Set up e-mail specifically for marketing (marketing@example.com).
* Register with all appropriate social media outlets and platforms.
* Set up google alerts, have them directed to your phone and e-mail.
* Set up google analytics on relevant pages.
* Add FB tracking pixel to relevant pages (somewhat unethical, but marketing and advertising is pretty unethical. See [Hicks' sketch](https://youtu.be/-gd01vfKfr0) - don't take it seriously, I have been in advertising and marketing).
* Assumption: Mailchimp has already been set up.
* Add Mailchimp tracking pixel.
* Use short links such as YOURLS (which is open-source). It's pretty easy to set up a bit.ly clone, but it's mainly the data laws that we have to comply with, I'm pretty sure bit.ly handles all that for you.
* SEO (I have **some** experience with this, but it is hugely outdated).
* Ensure appropriate data laws are followed.

**Processes & Responsibilities:**

* Regular Progress Tweets (transparency adds value to brand image).
* Regular Engagement on Twitter (with others, retweets, comments, likes).
* Facebook is somewhat less important. Just push stuff to FB when an article is going out, or some interesting news is trending.
* IG is linked to FB, so that is likely where most of the data for advertising would come from.
* Minimum 1 IG post per day.
* Usually 3 IG posts per day.
* Hashtag optimisation (you need to use different hashtags often, you also need to find niche hashtags, but they must all be relatable to the mission).
* I hear you now also have to regularly post IG reels?
* You need to be following other people who share similar values.
* You need notifications for when the people you're following (with large user bases) post comments so that you can be the first to comment. Their audience then also becomes your audience (or at least that is how it use to work).
* You have to (and you shouldn't automate this, but you can, however, you might get banned) ENGAGE with regular users, so they are led into this feeling of being noticed, thus increasing the likelihood they will follow you. You target people based on the number of followers they have and the number of people they're following (typically).
* Half the day could be spent commenting on other peoples posts who are interested in whatever it is your marketing.
* LinkedIn is for professional use but is important. I'm much less clued up on that.
* I don't really know much about YouTube or Telegram.
* Typically one newsletter should go out per week.

**Keeping Track of Things:**

* As soon as interesting news hits, you'll know from google alerts, allowing you to repost it quickly.
* Monitor Appropriate Google Trends (you can tailor content to what is trending in some instances, which usually results in higher engagement, faster organic growth initially; and then since you have an engaged LEGITIMATE AUDIENCE, not a f***ing purchased one - NEVER BY FOLLOWERS - yes, so once you have a legitimate audience and you're seeing diminishing returns on organic growth, slowly begin to allocate budget to add-spend.
* Monitor RoAS.
* Monitor growth, if it's not accelerating, something is wrong.

*TODO: if there is any interest in this, I can properly flesh something out with a professional marketing guy who is a close friend.*

Open to discussion.

## How might we want to distribute resources?

I would suggest a webpage/blog for articles. Post to relevant social media outlets.

Anything rather academic: featured on webpage/pinned on the blog & e-mailed to list. Post to all social media outlets.

Create a queriable knowledge base.

### Footnotes

<a href="#fn1" id="fn1">1</a>. As the phrase goes "the wheels of justice turn slowly", similarly, democratic processes such as voting on-chain between a large pool of participants for many different decisions would likely introduce a slowing of processes. Furthermore, a flood of proposals would likely become too much for every member to 'pay attention to' on a daily basis; thus, voting on everything initially would seem to me to be a not so great idea. I would propose delegating the DAO members 'virtual' voting power (since they don't actually have any right now) to WG leads, which is essentially what we're already doing.
