### Meeting Prep For Saturday 22nd Jan (18:00 UTC)

Following from yesterdays meeting (thank you all again for your time, I felt that it went well): I have reached out to a number of front-end devs (or people who have more experience with front-end frameworks than I do), some I went to university with & some I've previously worked with. I've not made myself any kind of representative of the organisation, I was just asking about React, their experience & if they would be open to an interesting side project, etc. I only approached the most competent people I know, and they said they would also ask anybody who has a stake in ADA (as they do). Thus they do understand the role, insofar as creating a UI for a distributed ledger & blockchain protocol based system (a dApp).

I will report back if I get any responses.

In the meantime, whilst I don't expect to be able to contribute, I will take some time to begin learning React (or similar front-end frameworks) since we've been discussing UIs for education, thus similar tooling will likely come in handy there.

**Availability For Next Meeting:**

* Monday 10:00 UTC until 23:00 UTC.
* Tuesday 10:00 UTC until 23:00 UTC
* Thursday 10:00 UTC until 23:00 UTC
* Friday 12:00 UTC until 22:00 UTC.
* Saturday 12:00 UTC until 22:00 UTC.

**Additional Notes From Last Meeting:**

In case anyone is working within the area of 'grow Latin America' (catalyst) - feel free to drop me a message and I can connect you with my friend who went down there in anticipation of preparing a proposal for Cardano-hubs, which we ultimately decided against. We have a fair amount of documentation and some video recordings which were very much 'in the moment' interviews that may be helpful.

Regarding motivation, all you've got to do is watch this summary of the book I mentioned, Drive (Daniel Pink): <https://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc>
